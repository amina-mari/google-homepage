This is my second project made in The Odin Project's Foundations Course. It's a Google Homepage copy, with HTML and CSS. This is my first project using Git too. 
This time I'm trying to explore more the display property (using Flexbox a lot but display block, inline, and Grid too) and the position property using it to make some adjustments on the page, especially on the dropdowns.
And even if that is a small project, I'm really enjoying doing this and putting my best effort on it.
Hope you enjoy it :)
